java methods :

              - a method is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
             - You can pass data, known as parameters, into a method.
             - Methods are used to perform certain actions, and they are also known as FUNCTION.
             - we use methods to reduce code : define the code once, and use it many times.


CREATING A METHOD : 
              - a method must be declared within a class.
              - it is defined with the name of the method, followed by parentheses ().

For example :

public class Main {
  static void myMethod() {
    // code to be executed
  }
}




JAVA PARAMETERS : 

  - parameters and arguments : 
             - information can be passed to methods as parameter. parameters act as variables inside the method.
             - parameters are specified after the method name, inside the parantheses. 
             - we can add as many parameters as we want, by just sepsrste them with a comma.

For example :


public class Main {
  static void myMethod(String fname) {
    System.out.println(fname + " Refsnes");
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    myMethod("Liam");
    myMethod("Jenny");
    myMethod("Anja");
  }
}
// Liam Refsnes
// Jenny Refsnes
// Anja Refsnes
